## VCOs
There are three VCOs - one with triangle and square outputs and two with saw outputs. 

The 4 CV inputs provide increasing levels of modulation, indicated by the white triangle above them. These won't track 1/V per octave. 

Each VCO has 2 sync inputs -one uses a diode and the other an LED. They behave differently (the LED is a bit wilder). Remember: If the signal that's doing the sycning is faster than the oscillator being synced, you won't hear anything. Patch hint: Try patching into both sync inputs!

The "trisq" VCO is fast by default. You can patch the 2 points labeled "medium" or "slow" together to change the speed. Itâ€™s equivalent to a 3-way "range" switch. 

# Filter
The filter section is probably the strangest part of the synth. You won't always need something plugged into the filter input, since the filter is very resonant when turned up. The potentiometers controls the resonance, while the cutoff is controlled by patching into the CV-A and CV-B inputs. These effect the 2 different stages of the filter. For the most typical filter behavior patch the same signal into both of them. There are lowpass, bandpass (2 of them), and highpass outputs. 
Both filters are the same except the right one is tuned higher.

Patch hint: Patching the BP into the left mixer and the HP into the right mixer (from the same filter) can give you a nice stereo effect.

# Divider
There are 2 frequency divider sections. They are separated by a vertical white line that is kind of hard to see. You patch in a clock and get a division from /1 to /16. The output will always be a square wave. 

Patch tip: insert  capacitors between divisions to create some swoooopy modulations. 

# Buffer
This is just an extra buffer. It can be used to overdrive a signal or just buffer a weak signal. For example, the DAC isn't buffered and in certain situations could need to be passed through this buffer.

# R2R DAC
The DAC takes 4 binary inputs and generates a stepped voltage on the output. The 2 output pins are taken from different points in the R2R ladder, so they will be different, but related. 

Patch hint: Feeding the DAC with outputs from the divider section, then using that as CV for an oscillator will generate cool arpeggios.

# Shift Register
The shift register clock expects a clean square wave. When feeding it something else (like a triangle, saw or the output of the filter), it can behave inconsistantly, but sometimes that's *cool*. If you want it to work "properly", pass the offending signal through the /1 on the divider before going into the clock. This basically turns any signal into a square wave. 

# Mixer
Like the CV inputs, the mixer inputs provide increasing amplitude as you patch into it, left to right. Actually the 2 ones in the middle are the same amplitude (I found I used them the most), but the left one is the quietiest and the right one is the loudest.

# Ground pins
These allow you to connect multiple roundabouts together. 


# Inspiration 
I referenced, borrowed and learned from a variety of sources for this project. 

The general structure of having simple patchable circuit blocks came from the [Lorre Mille Double Knot](https://lorre-mill.com/doubleknot) and [Elliot Williams' Klangorium](https://github.com/hexagon5un/klangorium).

For the VCOs, I referenced [quite](http://evilturtle.nl/projects/fmdronesynth.htm) [a](https://electro-music.com/forum/topic-28799.html) [few](https://hackaday.com/2015/09/11/logic-noise-playing-in-tune-with-an-exponential-vco/) [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qxgwN9aq8E) [sources](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WSG2010/wsg_page9.html#PSEUDOCV).

The logic blocks were largely inspired by the awesome ["Logic Noise" series of articles on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/tag/logic-noise/).
